Of course. Based on the provided guidelines for the SMDS-2 course, here is a suggested roadmap to help you structure and execute your final project effectively.

This roadmap is divided into six phases, breaking down the project into manageable steps from conception to final presentation.

### **Phase 1: Foundation and Planning**

This initial phase is about choosing your topic, finding the right data, and defining the scope of your analysis.

* **Step 1: Identify a Research Area and Dataset.**
    * Your project must be an in-depth Bayesian analysis of **real data**.
    * Look for inspiration and appropriate statistical models in reference textbooks, vignettes, or software documentation.
    * Search for datasets from literature, public sources (like government websites), or data repositories.

* **Step 2: Define Inferential Goals and Select a Primary Model.**
    * Once you have a dataset, clearly state the research questions you aim to answer. This will define the **inferential goals** of your analysis.
    * Choose a primary, appropriate statistical model to address these goals.
    * Give your project a **meaningful title**.

* **Step 3: Initial Consultation (Recommended).**
    * At this stage, consider consulting the instructor or tutor. You can discuss your dataset, the proposed model, and your research goals to ensure you are on the right track.

### **Phase 2: Model Implementation and MCMC**

Here, you will set up your tools and run the core of your Bayesian analysis.

* **Step 4: Set Up Your Software Environment.**
    * You are free to use tools like **Winbugs/JAGS, R packages** (e.g., rstan, brms), or other alternative software for your analysis.

* **Step 5: Implement and Run Your Model.**
    * Code your statistical model, specifying the likelihood and prior distributions.
    * Run the MCMC simulation to generate samples from the posterior distribution of your model's parameters.

* **Step 6: Assess MCMC Convergence.**
    * This is a critical step. You must illustrate and discuss the **MCMC convergence diagnostics**. Use tools like trace plots, autocorrelation plots, and other metrics to ensure your simulation has produced reliable results.

### **Phase 3: Analysis and Model Comparison**

With a converged model, you can now interpret the results and compare them against an alternative.

* **Step 7: Analyze and Report Inferential Findings.**
    * From the MCMC output, calculate and illustrate the main findings. This should include **Bayesian point and interval estimation** (e.g., posterior means and credible intervals) and any relevant **hypothesis testing**.

* **Step 8: Implement and Analyze an Alternative Model.**
    * Propose and develop a second, **alternative statistical model**. This allows you to test different assumptions or structures.

* **Step 9: Perform Model Comparison.**
    * Compare the performance of your two models. The guidelines specifically ask you to use the **DIC (Deviance Information Criterion) and/or marginal likelihood** for this comparison.

### **Phase 4: Enhancing Your Analysis (Bonus Points)**

The guidelines list three specific areas that can earn you extra credit. Plan to incorporate at least one of these for a higher evaluation.

* **Step 10: Check Parameter Recovery with Simulated Data (Bonus).**
    * Simulate data from your model with known parameters. Then, apply your Bayesian analysis to this simulated data to verify that it can accurately recover the true parameter values.

* **Step 11: Use Model Checking Diagnostics (Bonus).**
    * Go beyond convergence diagnostics and check how well your model fits the data. The guidelines suggest using techniques from Chapter 10 of Ntzoufras (2010), such as posterior predictive checks.

* **Step 12: Conduct a Comparative Frequentist Analysis (Bonus).**
    * Perform an analysis of the same data using frequentist methods and compare the results with your Bayesian findings.

### **Phase 5: Reporting**

This phase focuses on creating the final written document.

* **Step 13: Draft Your Written Report.**
    * The project must be submitted as a **written report**. Structure it clearly according to the five points in the guidelines:
        1.  Illustration of the dataset.
        2.  Explanation of the statistical model, its parameters, and inferential goals.
        3.  Illustration of the main inferential findings.
        4.  Discussion of the alternative model and the results of the model comparison.
        5.  Illustration of MCMC convergence diagnostics.
    * Integrate any bonus analyses you performed.

* **Step 14: Include Figures and Tables.**
    * Your report must be supported by **enclosed figures and tables** that are clearly labeled and referenced in the text.

### **Phase 6: Final Submission and Oral Presentation**

The final step is submitting your work and preparing for the oral defense.

* **Step 15: Submit the Project.**
    * Once the report is complete, submit it as instructed.

* **Step 16: Prepare for the Oral Presentation.**
    * After submission, you will be asked to **illustrate your project orally**. Prepare a summary of your work, focusing on the key findings and methodology.
    * Be ready for a **discussion on the topics covered in the course**, as the evaluation may extend beyond the project itself.
