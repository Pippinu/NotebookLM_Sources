Yes, the assumption that the observations $Y_1, ..., Y_n$ are **Independent and Identically Distributed (i.i.d.)** conditional on the parameter $\theta$ is **crucial** for the specific conjugate analyses (Poisson-Gamma and Binomial-Beta) as they were presented in the slides and examples.
Here's why:
1. **Likelihood Construction:** The i.i.d. assumption allows us to write the joint likelihood of the entire dataset $y = (y_1, ..., y_n)$ as the product of the individual probability mass/density functions:
$L_y(\theta) = f(y_1, ..., y_n | \theta) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} f(y_i | \theta)$
This step is fundamental to deriving the overall shape of the likelihood function.
2. **Specific Likelihood Form:** It's this product form under the i.i.d. assumption that simplifies nicely for these models:
* **Poisson:** Assuming $Y_i \sim Poisson(\theta)$ i.i.d., the product becomes $L_y(\theta) \propto \prod e^{-\theta} \theta^{y_i} = e^{-n\theta} \theta^{\sum y_i}$.
* **Bernoulli/Binomial:** Assuming $Y_i \sim Bernoulli(\theta)$ i.i.d., the product becomes $L_y(\theta) \propto \prod \theta^{y_i} (1-\theta)^{1-y_i} = \theta^{\sum y_i} (1-\theta)^{n-\sum y_i}$. (If we observe the total count $y = \sum y_i$ from $N$ trials, the Binomial likelihood $L_y(\theta) \propto \theta^y (1-\theta)^{N-y}$ has the same kernel structure).
3. **Matching for Conjugacy:** The conjugacy works precisely because the kernel of the prior distribution (Gamma for Poisson $\theta$, Beta for Binomial $\theta$) has the same mathematical structure (functional form depending on $\theta$) as the kernel of the likelihood derived under the i.i.d. assumption.
* Poisson likelihood kernel $e^{-n\theta} \theta^{\sum y_i}$ matches the Gamma kernel $\theta^{s-1} e^{-r\theta}$.
* Binomial/Bernoulli likelihood kernel $\theta^{\sum y_i} (1-\theta)^{n-\sum y_i}$ matches the Beta kernel $\theta^{a-1} (1-\theta)^{b-1}$.
**What if the data wasn't i.i.d.?**
If the observations were:
* **Not independent:** (e.g., $Y_i$ depends on $Y_{i-1}$)
* **Not identically distributed:** (e.g., $Y_i \sim Poisson(\theta_i)$ where $\theta_i$ varies, perhaps depending on some covariates $x_i$)
Then the likelihood function $L_y(\theta)$ would have a different form. In most such cases, the simple product structure is lost, and the resulting likelihood would likely **not** have the specific functional form required for the Gamma or Beta priors to remain conjugate. The analysis would typically become non-conjugate, requiring computational approximations (like MCMC methods discussed later in your syllabus).
**Connection to Exchangeability:**
In Bayesian statistics, the assumption is often framed in terms of **exchangeability**. A sequence of random variables is exchangeable if their joint distribution is unchanged by any permutation of the indices. De Finetti's theorem states that if a sequence is infinitely exchangeable, it behaves *as if* the observations are i.i.d. conditional on some underlying parameter(s) drawn from a prior distribution. So, the conditional i.i.d. assumption used in these models is often seen as a consequence of assuming exchangeability for the observations. (See slides 102-105).
**In summary:** Yes, the i.i.d. (conditional on $\theta$) assumption is fundamental to the specific likelihood forms that make the Gamma prior conjugate for the Poisson rate and the Beta prior conjugate for the Binomial probability in the standard examples discussed. Relaxing this assumption generally breaks the conjugacy.
