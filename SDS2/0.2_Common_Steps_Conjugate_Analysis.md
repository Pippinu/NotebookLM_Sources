Common logical workflow when performing and explaining a **conjugate Bayesian analysis**:
1. **Likelihood ($f(y|\theta)$):** Start by defining the probability model for your data, given the unknown parameter(s) $\theta$. This function describes how the data depends on the parameter. (e.g., Binomial, Poisson).
2. **Conjugate Prior ($\pi(\theta)$):** Choose a prior distribution for $\theta$ from a family that is known to be conjugate to the likelihood function you selected in Step 1. (e.g., Beta for Binomial, Gamma for Poisson). This step might involve prior elicitation to select specific hyperparameters ($a,b$ or $r,s$, etc.).
3. **Posterior ($\pi(\theta|y)$):** Determine the resulting posterior distribution by applying Bayes' theorem ($\pi(\theta|y) \propto f(y|\theta)\pi(\theta)$). Because of conjugacy, you know the posterior will belong to the *same family* as the prior.
4. **Parameter Update Rule:** Identify the simple rules that show how the hyperparameters of the posterior distribution (e.g., $a_{post}, b_{post}$) are calculated based on the hyperparameters of the prior distribution ($a_{prior}, b_{prior}$) and the observed data (e.g., $y_{obs}, N$). This is the computational payoff of using a conjugate prior.
5. **Reparameterization (Optional but common):** Often, the prior/posterior distribution family (like Beta or Gamma) can be reparameterized using more interpretable parameters (e.g., mean and concentration/strength). Analyzing the update rule using these alternative parameters often provides deeper insight into how the prior information and data information are combined (e.g., showing the posterior mean as a weighted average). This step aids significantly in *understanding* and *explaining* the results, even if it's not strictly necessary for the calculation itself.
So, **steps 1 through 4 are the essential core sequence** of performing a conjugate analysis. **Step 5 is a very common and highly useful addition** for interpreting the prior, the posterior, and the updating process, particularly for distributions like Beta and Gamma.
