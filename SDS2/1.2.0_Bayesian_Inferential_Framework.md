**Slide 22: The Bayesian Inferential Framework (Sources 42-43)**
This slide steps back slightly to show the "big picture" of how Bayesian inference works in general, regardless of whether you're using a conjugate model or not. It outlines a 3-step process:
1. **INPUT:**
* This is where you define your complete Bayesian model: $J(y,\theta) = \pi(\theta)f(y|\theta)$.
* It emphasizes that this involves making *assumptions*: choosing a statistical model for your data (the likelihood $f(y|\theta)$) and choosing a prior distribution for the unknown parameters ($\pi(\theta)$).
* These choices should ideally reflect your knowledge and beliefs about the phenomenon, though sometimes simplifying assumptions are made for convenience. (Source 42)
2. **INFERENTIAL ENGINE:**
* This is the core mechanism of Bayesian learning: **conditioning on the observed data** ($Y=y_{obs}$). Mathematically, this is done using Bayes' Rule. (Source 42)
3. **OUTPUT:**
* The result of the "engine" is the **posterior distribution** $\pi(\theta|y_{obs})$. (Source 42)
* This posterior distribution represents your *complete updated state of knowledge* about the unknown parameter $\theta$ after considering the data. (Source 43)
* From this posterior distribution, you can derive various summaries and perform different types of inference:
* **Point estimates:** Single best guesses for $\theta$ (like the posterior mean, median, or mode).
* **Interval estimates:** Ranges where $\theta$ is likely to fall with a certain probability (Credible Intervals, Highest Posterior Density intervals).
* **Hypothesis testing:** Evaluating the probability of different hypotheses about $\theta$. (Source 43)
**In essence, Slide 22 provides a conceptual map of the entire Bayesian process.**
