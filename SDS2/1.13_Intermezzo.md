Based on the PDF slides you provided, here's a summary of the content from slide 138 to 143:

1.  **DAG Representations (Slides 138-139):**
    * These two slides use Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to visually represent the relationship between parameters ($\theta$), observed data ($X_1, ..., X_n$), and potential future data ($X_{new}$) in a typical Bayesian setup.
    * Slide 138 shows the structure *before* data observation, with the parameter influencing all observations.
    * Slide 139 shows the structure *after* observing data, illustrating how the observed data now influences the belief about the parameter ($\theta$), which in turn influences the prediction for $X_{new}$.

2.  **Poisson Model Conjugate Analysis Setup (Brief Recap) (Slide 140):**
    * This slide briefly restates the setup for the Poisson model ($Y_i | \theta \sim Poisson(\theta)$ i.i.d.) and identifies the functional form of the likelihood kernel ($\propto e^{-b_{lik}\theta} \theta^{a_{lik}}$).
    * It sets the stage for recognizing the conjugate Gamma prior by matching this functional form, serving as a quick transition or reminder before the next example.

3.  **Binomial Capture Example (Discrete Parameter Model) (Slides 141-143):**
    * This section introduces a different type of problem: estimating an unknown **discrete parameter**, the population size $N$.
    * **Model:** Individuals ($i=1...N$) are captured ($Z_i=1$) with a *known* probability $p_0$. The total number of captured individuals $S = \sum Z_i$ is observed. Given $N$, the number of captures $S$ follows a Binomial distribution: $S|N, p_0 \sim Bin(N, p_0)$.
    * **Likelihood:** The likelihood function is derived for the unknown parameter $N$, given the observed count $s$: $L_s(N) = P(S=s|N, p_0) = \binom{N}{s} p_0^s (1-p_0)^{N-s}$, defined for $N \ge s$. The kernel proportional to $N!/(N-s)! (1-p_0)^N$ is highlighted (Slide 141).
    * **Prior:** A simple discrete Uniform prior is chosen for $N$ over a range $\{1, ..., N_{max}\}$ (Slide 141 [cite: 306]).
    * **Posterior:** The posterior probability mass function $\pi(N|s)$ is derived (up to proportionality) by multiplying the likelihood and the prior (Slide 142).
    * **Posterior Mode (MAP):** An analytical derivation is shown to find the mode of the posterior distribution by comparing $\pi(N|s)$ to $\pi(N-1|s)$. The result is $Mo[N|s] = \lfloor s/p_0 \rfloor$ (Slide 142).
    * **Further Questions:** The section concludes by posing questions about how to calculate other posterior summaries (mean, median), how to simulate from this discrete posterior, how interval estimation or hypothesis testing would work, and the impact of using different discrete priors (Slide 143).

In essence, this block transitions from visualizing model structures (DAGs) and briefly revisiting the Poisson model setup to working through a specific example involving a **discrete parameter** ($N$) where the mode could be found analytically, contrasting with the continuous parameter examples discussed earlier.
