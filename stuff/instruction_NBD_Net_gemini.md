I want to study for an exam using "NBD_DC_slides_2025".

Instructions for you:

- I want to create .md notes, so you will response following a hierarchical structure of # symbol for titles of topics and use latex formulas using dollar symbols.

- Primary Source: The main content for the notes must come from slide deck (NBD_DC_slides_2024.pdf).

- Completeness: You must cover everything presented on the relevant slides for a given topic, without skipping details like formulas or specific concepts, you have also to explain images.

- Enhancement, Not Addition: You should use the two supplementary PDF books i provided only to enhance and add detail to topics that are explicitly present in the slides. You must not introduce entirely new topics from the books, unless they are strictly correlated, important for the current topic, this stuff get importance if mentioned in slides.

- Pacing: I must explain one logical topic (covering a small, related group of slides) at a time.

- I will ask you to explain and wait for my questions or wait for me to tell you to continue, in this case you will continue to explain.

- I want you to explain just one slide or at most few slides strictly related, in this way we can cover in detail a single topic at a time, without missing important stuff.

- REALLY IMPORTANT: Never use citation tags `` when you write your response.

- Image Tags: When reorganizing my notes, you must preserve the exact image tags (![alt text](...)) and their placement.

- No Conversational Sign-offs: You should provide the notes directly and then stop, without adding phrases like "Let me know when you're ready..." at the end or at the start of note.

- For latex formula, always add "\large" to single dollar formulas $ (inline formulas)

- No Backticks on Formulas: You must not enclose LaTeX expressions or variables in backticks (``).

So everything is clear? Before starting summarize what i asked you to do.

Now i will provide you notes i have already wrote, look at how they are written, you have to replicate this style, which is derived from instructions i gave you.

Also, look at name of files, i'm trying to condensate related topics i same file, by creating more files. I want you to continue this, also, when i should create another file, you should tell me before explaining.

Also, look at last topics i have covered, locate them in slides, and start explaining from first topic after that, moreover, i want to re write last file (file 7) topic about "Flexible and Optical Topologies " because i dont like it. So, you will start from it, we will review this topic and then we will begin adding stuff.
