I want to study for an exam using "NBD_DC_slides_2024", in particular i want to create .md notes about them. 
You will explain, IMPORTANT, JUST one or few slides related to the same concept, not everything together, in this way it's easier for you to better explain and for me to better understand. Also, refer to the other 2 pdf that are book professor suggest to watch at to expand concepts where needed.

You can skip concepts until data center networks, you can cover the part about NIST topics, elasticitiy and stuff like that in a fast way because another exam that i have to do around that date cover in details it, so talk about it but in a fast and superficial way.

IMPORTANT to remember: Do not use citations tags, NEVER, so i do not have to remove them manually everytime.

So everything is clear? Before starting summarize what i asked you to do.
