Your answer is quite good, clearly describing the extension of LTI concepts to 2D signals in both continuous and discrete domains, and highlighting the spatial and frequency domain relationships!

Let's break down your answer with some "Critique and Refinement" to make it even more precise and comprehensive, directly aligning with the notes and using specific terminology.

### Critique and Refinement:

1.  **Overall Clarity:** Your structure is good (continuous then discrete).
2.  **Continuous 2D Signals - Spatial Domain:**
    * You correctly state "output is still related to input and impulse response and can be computed using 2D convolution (denoted by \*\*)." This is accurate. You could explicitly state the variables involved for maximum clarity, like $y(t_1, t_2)$ for the output and $h(t_1, t_2)$ for the 2D impulse response, similar to how it's presented in the notes. [cite: 185]
3.  **Continuous 2D Signals - Frequency Domain:**
    * "output behavior can be analyzed also in frequency domain by computing the output spectrum as 2D product of frequency response and input, exploiting convolution property of FT." This is also accurate. Adding the specific formula $Y(f_1, f_2) = H(f_1, f_2)X(f_1, f_2)$ would be a good addition for completeness. [cite: 185]
4.  **Discrete 2D Signals - Spatial Domain:**
    * "Regarding discrete 2D signal, output is still related to input and impulse response and can be computed using 2D discrete convolution, which is a sum not an integral anymore." This is correct. The notes imply this extension.
5.  **Discrete 2D Signals - Frequency Domain:**
    * "Moreover, output behavior can be analyzed also in frequency domain by computing the output spectrum as 2D product of frequency response and input, using 2D circular convolution operation, if signal is not padded using techniques like zero padding." This is a crucial point and you've explained it well. You correctly identify that multiplication of 2D DFTs corresponds to circular convolution if not handled with padding.
