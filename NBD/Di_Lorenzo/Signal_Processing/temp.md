## 1. Overview and Classification

The purpose of the physical layer is to transport bits between machines. The physical media used for this transport are classified into two main groups:

* **Guided Media**: These use a physical path, like a cable, to guide the signal from sender to receiver. Examples include copper wire and fiber optic cables.
* **Unguided Media**: These transmit signals through the air or space without a physical conductor. This is also known as wireless communication. Examples include radio waves, microwaves, and satellite links.

## 3. Unguided Transmission Media (Wireless)

Wireless communication uses the electromagnetic spectrum to transmit signals.

* **Radio Waves**:
    * Used by technologies like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.
    * They are omnidirectional (travel in all directions) and can penetrate obstacles like walls, making them ideal for indoor networks.

* **Microwaves**:
    * Higher frequency waves that travel in a straight line (line-of-sight).
    * Used for point-to-point communication, such as connecting two buildings or for satellite communications. They are easily blocked by solid objects.

* **Satellite Communication**:
    * A satellite in orbit acts as a microwave repeater in the sky.
    * It receives a signal from a ground station, amplifies it, and re-broadcasts it to a receiving station elsewhere on Earth.
    * The altitude of the satellite (LEO, MEO, GEO) significantly impacts the signal delay (latency).
